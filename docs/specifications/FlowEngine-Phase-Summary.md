## Phase 3 Planning Overview

### Strategic Direction

Phase 3 shifts focus from core infrastructure to **plugin ecosystem expansion** and **enterprise feature development**, while maintaining the performance characteristics established in Phases 1 and 2.

### Phase 3 Architecture: Five-Component Pattern

Phase 3 introduces a standardized **five-component architecture** for all plugins:

```
Plugin Assembly
├── Configuration    # Schema-mapped YAML config
├── Validator       # Configuration & schema validation  
├── Plugin          # Main plugin class & lifecycle
├── Processor       # Process coordination & orchestration
└── Service         # Core processing & business logic
```

This pattern ensures consistency, maintainability, and optimal ArrayRow performance across the entire plugin ecosystem.

### Phase 3 Roadmap (16 Weeks)

## Gap Analysis

### Identified Gaps

1. **Documentation Organization** ⚠️
   - Current: Large, comprehensive documents mixing concerns
   - Needed: Focused, task-oriented guides (3-5 pages each)
   - Impact: Developer onboarding efficiency
   - **Resolution**: Implement recommended documentation structure

2. **Plugin Development Experience** ⚠️
   - Current: Core interfaces defined but no development guide
   - Needed: Plugin development cookbook and templates
   - Impact: Plugin ecosystem growth
