# FlowEngine Development Workflow

**Last Updated**: January 2025  
**Purpose**: Define sprint-lite development methodology for FlowEngine production hardening

## Overview

FlowEngine uses a **sprint-lite** approach focused on production hardening rather than feature expansion. This workflow emphasizes quality, stability, and evidence-based progress tracking.

## Sprint Philosophy

### **Quality Over Quantity**
- Polish existing features vs adding new ones
- Make current capabilities production-ready
- Fix issues before expanding scope

### **Evidence-Based Progress**
- All claims backed by working code or tests
- Documentation updated with code changes
- Performance measured, not estimated

### **Simplification Focus**
- Remove complexity and confusion
- Streamline configurations and APIs
- Eliminate overlapping functionality

## Cyclical Sprint Types (3-Sprint Rotation)

### **Performance Sprints (2 weeks)**
**Focus**: Optimize speed, throughput, and resource usage

**Examples**:
- JavaScript AST pre-compilation (2x performance improvement)
- Global context optimization (additional 2-3x improvement)
- Memory allocation reduction
- Parallel processing implementation

**Deliverables**:
- Measurable performance improvements
- BenchmarkDotNet validation
- Performance regression tests
- Updated performance documentation

### **Simplification Sprints (1 week)**
**Focus**: Remove complexity and improve usability

**Examples**:
- Configuration cleanup (remove OverwriteExisting vs AppendMode confusion)
- API simplification and consolidation
- CLI command streamlining
- Documentation clarity improvements

**Deliverables**:
- Cleaner interfaces
- Simplified configuration options
- Updated examples and documentation
- Reduced cognitive load for users

### **Stability Sprints (1 week)**
**Focus**: Error handling, reliability, and robustness

**Examples**:
- Comprehensive error handling implementation
- Retry/recovery mechanisms integration
- Integration test failure resolution
- Plugin loading stability improvements

**Deliverables**:
- Improved error handling
- Higher test success rates
- Better failure recovery
- Production-ready reliability

## Cycle Benefits

### **Balanced Development**
- **Prevents obsession** with single area (performance, usability, or stability)
- **Ensures holistic progress** across all production readiness dimensions
- **Maintains momentum** with varied, focused objectives
- **Builds cumulative quality** through repeated attention to each area

## Daily Development Rhythm

### **Start of Day**
1. Update sprint progress in `docs/sprints/active/README.md`
2. Review yesterday's work and test results
3. Identify today's specific goals

### **During Development**
1. Write tests before implementation (TDD)
2. Update documentation with code changes
3. Measure performance impact of changes
4. Update sprint document with decisions made

### **End of Day**
1. Run full test suite
2. Update sprint progress
3. Commit working changes
4. Note any blockers or decisions needed

## Sprint Lifecycle

### **Cycle Planning**
1. **Plan 3-sprint cycle** with Performance → Simplification → Stability rotation
2. **Identify cycle theme** (e.g., "JavaScript Optimization Cycle")
3. **Define cycle success criteria** across all three sprint types
4. **Update ROADMAP.md** with current cycle status

### **Sprint Planning**
1. Create new sprint document from template
2. Define clear, measurable goals **specific to sprint type**
3. Identify success criteria **aligned with sprint focus**
4. Update ROADMAP.md with sprint priorities

### **Daily Execution**
1. Update sprint document with daily progress
2. Make decisions and document in DECISIONS.md
3. Keep examples and documentation current
4. Address any test failures immediately

### **Sprint Completion**
1. Ensure all goals achieved or explicitly deferred
2. Update capabilities.md and limitations.md
3. Move sprint doc to completed/
4. **Update ROADMAP.md** with next sprint in rotation

### **Cycle Completion**
1. **Assess cycle success** across Performance → Simplification → Stability
2. **Document cycle achievements** in ROADMAP.md completed cycles
3. **Plan next cycle theme** (e.g., "Database Integration Cycle")
4. **Reset sprint rotation** to Performance for new cycle

## Definition of Done

### **For Code Changes**
- [ ] All existing tests pass
- [ ] New functionality has tests
- [ ] Performance impact measured
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Examples still work

### **For Sprint Completion**
- [ ] All stated goals achieved
- [ ] No regression in existing functionality
- [ ] Documentation reflects current state
- [ ] Next sprint priorities identified

### **For Production Readiness**
- [ ] 99.9% success rate on well-formed data
- [ ] Zero data corruption
- [ ] Predictable resource usage
- [ ] Clear error messages with solutions
- [ ] Comprehensive test coverage

## Documentation Standards

### **Sprint Documentation**
- Daily progress updates
- Decision rationale
- Issues encountered and resolved
- Links to commits and PRs

### **Code Documentation**
- XML documentation for public APIs
- Clear commit messages
- Pull request descriptions
- Performance impact notes

### **Current State Documentation**
- Keep capabilities.md accurate
- Update limitations.md as gaps are filled
- Maintain working examples
- Update configuration references

## Quality Gates

### **Code Quality**
- All integration tests >95% success rate
- No critical bugs in production pipeline
- Performance within ±10% of established baselines
- Memory usage remains bounded

### **Documentation Quality**
- No broken links or outdated references
- All examples execute successfully
- Performance claims match measured results
- Clear distinction between current and planned features

## Team Practices

### **Communication**
- Daily sprint document updates
- Decision documentation in DECISIONS.md
- Clear commit messages
- Responsive issue resolution

### **Collaboration**
- Code reviews for all changes
- Shared ownership of documentation
- Open discussion of technical decisions
- Knowledge sharing through documentation

## Success Metrics

### **Development Velocity**
- Sprint goals consistently achieved
- Minimal technical debt accumulation
- Steady progress on production readiness

### **Quality Improvement**
- Decreasing bug reports
- Increasing test success rates
- Improving performance consistency
- Better user experience feedback
