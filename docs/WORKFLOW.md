# FlowEngine Development Workflow

**Last Updated**: January 2025  
**Purpose**: Define sprint-lite development methodology for FlowEngine production hardening

## Overview

FlowEngine uses a **sprint-lite** approach focused on production hardening rather than feature expansion. This workflow emphasizes quality, stability, and evidence-based progress tracking.

## Sprint Philosophy

### **Quality Over Quantity**
- Polish existing features vs adding new ones
- Make current capabilities production-ready
- Fix issues before expanding scope

### **Evidence-Based Progress**
- All claims backed by working code or tests
- Documentation updated with code changes
- Performance measured, not estimated

### **Simplification Focus**
- Remove complexity and confusion
- Streamline configurations and APIs
- Eliminate overlapping functionality

## Sprint Types

### **Hardening Sprints (2 weeks)**
**Focus**: Make one aspect production-ready

**Examples**:
- Memory management production hardening
- Error handling sophistication
- Plugin reliability improvements

**Deliverables**:
- Bulletproof subsystem
- Comprehensive tests
- Updated documentation

### **Simplification Sprints (1 week)**
**Focus**: Remove complexity

**Examples**:
- Configuration cleanup (remove OverwriteExisting vs AppendMode confusion)
- API simplification
- Documentation consolidation

**Deliverables**:
- Cleaner interfaces
- Updated examples
- Simplified user experience

### **Polish Sprints (1 week)**
**Focus**: Developer experience

**Examples**:
- Better error messages
- Improved logging
- Enhanced debugging tools

**Deliverables**:
- Smoother user experience
- Clear error guidance
- Better troubleshooting

## Daily Development Rhythm

### **Start of Day**
1. Update sprint progress in `docs/sprints/active/README.md`
2. Review yesterday's work and test results
3. Identify today's specific goals

### **During Development**
1. Write tests before implementation (TDD)
2. Update documentation with code changes
3. Measure performance impact of changes
4. Update sprint document with decisions made

### **End of Day**
1. Run full test suite
2. Update sprint progress
3. Commit working changes
4. Note any blockers or decisions needed

## Sprint Lifecycle

### **Sprint Planning**
1. Create new sprint document from template
2. Define clear, measurable goals
3. Identify success criteria
4. Update ROADMAP.md with sprint priorities

### **Daily Execution**
1. Update sprint document with daily progress
2. Make decisions and document in DECISIONS.md
3. Keep examples and documentation current
4. Address any test failures immediately

### **Sprint Completion**
1. Ensure all goals achieved or explicitly deferred
2. Update capabilities.md and limitations.md
3. Move sprint doc to completed/
4. Update ROADMAP.md with next priorities

## Definition of Done

### **For Code Changes**
- [ ] All existing tests pass
- [ ] New functionality has tests
- [ ] Performance impact measured
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Examples still work

### **For Sprint Completion**
- [ ] All stated goals achieved
- [ ] No regression in existing functionality
- [ ] Documentation reflects current state
- [ ] Next sprint priorities identified

### **For Production Readiness**
- [ ] 99.9% success rate on well-formed data
- [ ] Zero data corruption
- [ ] Predictable resource usage
- [ ] Clear error messages with solutions
- [ ] Comprehensive test coverage

## Documentation Standards

### **Sprint Documentation**
- Daily progress updates
- Decision rationale
- Issues encountered and resolved
- Links to commits and PRs

### **Code Documentation**
- XML documentation for public APIs
- Clear commit messages
- Pull request descriptions
- Performance impact notes

### **Current State Documentation**
- Keep capabilities.md accurate
- Update limitations.md as gaps are filled
- Maintain working examples
- Update configuration references

## Quality Gates

### **Code Quality**
- All integration tests >95% success rate
- No critical bugs in production pipeline
- Performance within Â±10% of established baselines
- Memory usage remains bounded

### **Documentation Quality**
- No broken links or outdated references
- All examples execute successfully
- Performance claims match measured results
- Clear distinction between current and planned features

## Team Practices

### **Communication**
- Daily sprint document updates
- Decision documentation in DECISIONS.md
- Clear commit messages
- Responsive issue resolution

### **Collaboration**
- Code reviews for all changes
- Shared ownership of documentation
- Open discussion of technical decisions
- Knowledge sharing through documentation

## Success Metrics

### **Development Velocity**
- Sprint goals consistently achieved
- Minimal technical debt accumulation
- Steady progress on production readiness

### **Quality Improvement**
- Decreasing bug reports
- Increasing test success rates
- Improving performance consistency
- Better user experience feedback
