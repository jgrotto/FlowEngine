# FlowEngine Documentation Archive

⚠️ **HISTORICAL REFERENCE ONLY** ⚠️

## Purpose

This archive contains historical documentation from FlowEngine's development phases. **This content is preserved for context and learning but does NOT represent current capabilities or implementation status.**

## ⚠️ Important Disclaimers

- **Performance claims in archived documents may be outdated or aspirational**
- **Feature descriptions may not reflect current implementation**
- **Architecture documents may describe planned vs implemented systems**
- **For current capabilities, see `/docs/current/capabilities.md`**
- **For current limitations, see `/docs/current/limitations.md`**

## Archive Structure

### Phase 1 Archive (`phase-1/`)
Early FlowEngine development and initial implementations.

### Phase 2 Archive (`phase-2/`)
Phase 2 development, specifications, and Architecture Decision Records (ADRs).

### Phase 3 Archive (`phase-3/`)
Phase 3 sprint work, plugin implementations, and architectural refinements.

### Early Specifications (`early-specs/`)
Original project specifications, implementation plans, and technical documents.

## Using Archived Content

### ✅ **Appropriate Uses**
- Understanding design decisions and evolution
- Learning from past architectural choices
- Context for current implementation patterns
- Historical perspective on project development

### ❌ **Inappropriate Uses**
- Determining current feature availability
- Performance expectations for current system
- API documentation for current implementation
- Development planning based on outdated specifications
