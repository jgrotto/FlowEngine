# FlowEngine Development Roadmap

**Last Updated**: January 2025  
**Focus**: Production hardening of existing CSV and JavaScript transformation capabilities  
**Timeline**: 18-month path to enterprise production readiness

## Current Phase: Foundation Stability

### **Strategic Direction**
Transform FlowEngine from "functional foundation" to "production-ready platform" by focusing on core excellence rather than feature expansion.

### **Core Principles**
1. **Polish existing foundation** rather than expand features
2. **CSV and JavaScript transforms exceptionally well** 
3. **Make it bulletproof** - every feature works flawlessly
4. **Fail fast & clear** - every error tells users how to fix it
5. **UI-ready design** - every config choice maps to simple controls

## Phase 1: Foundation Stability (Current Priority)

### **Goals**
- Fix prototype-level issues
- Stabilize core functionality
- Establish production-ready development practices

### **Critical Stability Fixes**
- [ ] **Fix 6 failing integration tests** - Address plugin loading and assembly isolation issues
- [ ] **Implement comprehensive error handling** - Wrap all operations with proper exception management
- [ ] **Add retry/recovery mechanisms** - Integrate ExponentialBackoffRetryPolicy into pipeline execution
- [ ] **Standardize plugin manifest format** - Choose one schema, migrate all plugins

### **Documentation Reality Check**
- [ ] **Remove inflated performance claims** - Document realistic 4K-7K rows/sec with transforms
- [ ] **Remove missing CLI features from docs** - `--validate`, `--variable` don't exist
- [ ] **Add operational troubleshooting guide** - Common issues and solutions
- [ ] **Document actual production limitations** - Be honest about current capabilities

### **Development Experience Improvements**
- [ ] **Create comprehensive integration test suite** - Cover real-world scenarios
- [ ] **Add performance regression tests** - Prevent performance degradation
- [ ] **Implement proper logging standards** - Structured, queryable logs
- [ ] **Add debugging and profiling tools** - Help developers diagnose issues

## Phase 2: Essential Production Features (6-12 months)

### **Goals**
- Minimum viable production deployment capability
- Basic enterprise security and monitoring
- Essential connectivity beyond files

### **Enterprise Security Baseline**
- [ ] **Implement basic authentication** - API key or token-based auth
- [ ] **Add audit logging** - Track all data processing activities
- [ ] **Implement data encryption** - At-rest and in-transit protection
- [ ] **Add secrets management** - Secure credential storage

### **Operational Monitoring**
- [ ] **Health check endpoints** - HTTP endpoints for load balancer health checks
- [ ] **Metrics collection and export** - Prometheus/OpenTelemetry integration
- [ ] **Structured logging with correlation** - Distributed tracing support
- [ ] **Basic alerting capability** - Error rate and performance alerts

### **Infrastructure Support**
- [ ] **Containerization (Docker)** - Standardized deployment packaging
- [ ] **Basic CI/CD pipeline** - Automated build, test, deploy
- [ ] **Configuration management** - Environment-specific configurations
- [ ] **Graceful shutdown handling** - Proper resource cleanup

### **Essential Connectivity**
- [ ] **Database source/sink plugins** - SQL Server, PostgreSQL, MySQL
- [ ] **REST API source/sink plugins** - HTTP-based integrations
- [ ] **Cloud storage plugins** - Azure Blob, AWS S3, GCP Storage
- [ ] **Message queue integration** - Azure Service Bus, RabbitMQ

## Phase 3: Enterprise Production (12-18 months)

### **Goals**
- Full enterprise-grade data processing platform
- High availability and scale
- Comprehensive governance and compliance

### **Enterprise Features**
- [ ] **Multi-tenancy support** - Tenant isolation and resource governance
- [ ] **Role-based access control** - Fine-grained permissions
- [ ] **Compliance reporting** - Audit trails and regulatory support
- [ ] **Data governance framework** - Lineage, quality, lifecycle management

### **High Availability & Scale**
- [ ] **Distributed processing** - Multi-node pipeline execution
- [ ] **Auto-scaling** - Dynamic resource allocation
- [ ] **Circuit breakers and bulkheads** - Fault isolation patterns
- [ ] **Backup and disaster recovery** - Data protection strategies

### **Advanced Operations**
- [ ] **Performance SLA monitoring** - Service level agreement tracking
- [ ] **Capacity planning tools** - Resource forecasting
- [ ] **Advanced deployment patterns** - Blue/green, canary deployments
- [ ] **Incident response automation** - Self-healing capabilities

## What We're NOT Doing

### **Scope Boundaries**
❌ **No New Data Sources** - Perfect CSV first  
❌ **No Enterprise Features** (Phase 1) - No auth, encryption, multi-tenancy  
❌ **No Distributed Processing** (Phases 1-2) - Single node excellence  
❌ **No Additional Formats** - CSV/TSV/PSV only  
❌ **No Complex Integrations** (Phase 1) - File in, file out

### **Rationale**
Focus resources on making current capabilities production-ready rather than expanding scope before achieving quality.

## Completed Milestones

### **✅ Feature Matrix Analysis (January 2025)**
- Comprehensive evidence-based assessment of current capabilities
- Honest documentation of production gaps
- Clear roadmap for production readiness

### **✅ Documentation Cleanup (January 2025)**
- Archived historical documents with clear warnings
- Created evidence-based current capabilities documentation
- Established honest limitations documentation

### **✅ Strategic Planning (January 2025)**
- Implementation strategy focused on production hardening
- Unified documentation strategy for single source of truth
- Sprint-lite development workflow definition

## Resource Requirements

| **Phase** | **Development Effort** | **Skills Required** | **Infrastructure** |
|-----------|----------------------|-------------------|------------------|
| **Phase 1** | 3-6 months, 2-3 developers | .NET, testing, DevOps basics | Development environment |
| **Phase 2** | 6-12 months, 4-6 developers | Security, monitoring, cloud platforms | Test/staging environments |
| **Phase 3** | 12-18 months, 6-10 developers | Distributed systems, enterprise architecture | Production infrastructure |

## Success Criteria

### **Phase 1 Success**
- 99.9% success rate on well-formed data
- Zero data corruption issues
- Predictable resource usage
- Sub-second startup time
- New user productive in 30 minutes

### **Phase 2 Success**
- Basic security model implemented
- Production deployment capability
- Essential monitoring and alerting
- Database and API connectivity

### **Phase 3 Success**
- Enterprise security and compliance
- High availability and auto-scaling
- Comprehensive governance features
- Advanced operational capabilities

## Decision Points

### **Continue Development If:**
- 18+ month timeline available
- 6+ developer capacity for production features
- Commitment to quality over speed

### **Consider Alternatives If:**
- Production needed in <12 months
- Limited development resources
- Enterprise features are immediate requirements
