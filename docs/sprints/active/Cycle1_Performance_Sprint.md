## Decisions

### Technical Architecture Decisions
- **Two-Phase Approach**: Phase 1 (Jint optimization) → Phase 2 (ClearScript replacement)
- **Service Layer Strategy**: Replace implementation without touching plugin code
- **Interface Abstraction**: Leverage IScriptEngineService for engine swapping
- **Zero Plugin Impact**: JavaScriptTransformPlugin uses dependency injection seamlessly
- **V8 Engine Selection**: ClearScript provides true AST pre-compilation capabilities

### Implementation Approach
- **Dependency Injection**: Service replacement via DI container registration
- **Interface Compatibility**: Maintain existing IScriptEngineService contract
- **Performance Validation**: Use existing 20K record test for V8 validation
- **Risk Mitigation**: Easy rollback by reverting service registration
- **Incremental Deployment**: Can A/B test engines via factory pattern

## Issues & Blockers

### Phase 1 Issues (Resolved)
- **AST Pre-compilation Limitation**: Jint does not support external AST pre-compilation
- **Performance Gap**: Achieved 34% improvement vs 100% target (5,350 vs 8,000 rows/sec)
- **Engine Constraints**: Limited by Jint's internal optimization capabilities

### Phase 2 Implementation Plan
- **ClearScript Integration**: Implement V8-based service with true AST pre-compilation
- **Plugin Compatibility**: Zero changes required to existing JavaScriptTransformPlugin
- **Performance Target**: Expected 8,000+ rows/sec with V8 optimization
