# Active Sprint: Documentation Cleanup & Strategic Foundation

**Dates**: January 12, 2025 (single-day sprint)  
**Type**: Simplification Sprint  
**Goal**: Clean up documentation to support evidence-based development workflow

## Sprint Objectives

### **Primary Goals**
1. âœ… **Archive historical documentation** - Move Phase 1/2/3 content to archive with clear warnings
2. âœ… **Create evidence-based current documentation** - capabilities.md and limitations.md from Feature Matrix
3. âœ… **Fix inflated performance claims** - Replace with measured results from actual testing
4. âœ… **Establish new documentation structure** - Per unified-doc-strategy.md

### **Success Criteria**
- [ ] All historical content archived with "reference only" warnings
- [ ] Current capabilities accurately reflect Feature Matrix findings
- [ ] Performance claims match measured test results
- [ ] AI Architect can reference repo without encountering conflicting information

## Tasks Completed

### **âœ… Archive Structure Creation**
- Created `/docs/archive/` with phase-1, phase-2, phase-3, early-specs subdirectories
- Added comprehensive archive README.md with usage guidelines and warnings
- Established clear rules for AI Architect archive access

### **âœ… Historical Document Migration**
- Moved all P3_*.md files to archive/phase-3/
- Moved Phase3*.md architecture documents to archive/phase-3/
- Moved Pipeline_Execution_Deadlock*.md analysis to archive/phase-3/
- Moved specifications/archive/* content to archive/early-specs/
- Moved Phase 2 documentation index to archive/phase-2/

### **âœ… Evidence-Based Documentation Creation**
- **capabilities.md**: Comprehensive list of working features based on Feature Matrix âœ… Working status
- **limitations.md**: Honest assessment of production gaps based on Feature Matrix ðŸš« Missing status
- Both documents include measured performance characteristics and actual test evidence

### **âœ… Performance Claims Correction**
- Updated docs/README.md performance section with realistic measurements
- Replaced "441K rows/sec" claims with actual "3,870-3,997 rows/sec" measurements
- Replaced "sub-nanosecond" claims with actual "25ns field access" measurements
- Added test scenario context for all performance numbers

### **âœ… New Documentation Structure**
- Created `/docs/current/` for active documentation
- Created `/docs/sprints/active/` and `/docs/sprints/completed/` for sprint tracking
- Implemented structure per unified-doc-strategy.md

### **âœ… Workflow Foundation Documents**
- **WORKFLOW.md**: Sprint-lite development methodology with hardening focus
- **ROADMAP.md**: 18-month production readiness roadmap with realistic timelines
- **DECISIONS.md**: Lightweight ADR log with key technical decisions documented

### **âœ… Navigation Updates**
- Updated docs/README.md to reference current capabilities and limitations
- Added current status warning about "functional foundation" positioning
- Fixed non-existent CLI feature references (removed --validate, --monitor-performance)
- Updated project status section to reference Feature Matrix and implementation strategy

## Key Decisions Made

### **Archive vs Delete Approach**
**Decision**: Archive with warnings rather than delete historical content  
**Rationale**: Preserves valuable context and architectural learning while preventing confusion  
**Implementation**: Clear "HISTORICAL REFERENCE ONLY" headers and AI Architect usage rules

### **Evidence-Based Documentation Standard**
**Decision**: All technical claims must be backed by working code, tests, or measurements  
**Rationale**: Builds credibility and prevents marketing/reality disconnect  
**Implementation**: Performance numbers from actual pipeline execution, features from Feature Matrix analysis

### **Production Hardening Focus**
**Decision**: Document current "functional foundation" status honestly  
**Rationale**: Sets realistic expectations and provides foundation for genuine production readiness  
**Implementation**: Clear status warnings, honest limitations documentation, realistic roadmap

## Results Achieved

### **âœ… Clean Information Architecture**
- Single source of truth for current capabilities
- Historical content preserved but clearly separated
- No conflicting information between active and archived docs

### **âœ… AI Architect Integration Ready**
- Repository serves as authoritative source for current state
- Clear rules for referencing archive vs current content
- Evidence-based documentation AI can trust and reference

### **âœ… Development Foundation Established**
- Sprint-lite workflow defined and documented
- Strategic roadmap aligned with Feature Matrix findings
- Decision log started for future architectural choices

### **âœ… Honest Positioning**
- "Functional foundation" status clearly communicated
- Production gaps documented without sugar-coating
- Realistic timeline and resource requirements specified

## Sprint Retrospective

### **What Went Well**
- Comprehensive analysis from Feature Matrix provided solid evidence base
- Archive approach preserved valuable historical context
- New documentation structure aligns well with development goals
- Realistic performance measurements improve credibility

### **Challenges Addressed**
- Significant volume of historical content required careful organization
- Inflated performance claims needed complete revision
- Multiple overlapping documents required consolidation decisions

### **Next Sprint Recommendations**
1. **Configuration Simplification Sprint** - Address OverwriteExisting vs AppendMode confusion
2. **Integration Test Hardening Sprint** - Fix 6 failing tests to achieve 95%+ success rate
3. **Error Handling Enhancement Sprint** - Implement sophisticated retry and recovery mechanisms
