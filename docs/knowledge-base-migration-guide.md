# Knowledge Base Migration Guide

**Document Type**: Team Reference Guide  
**Date**: July 12, 2025  
**Purpose**: Guide for transitioning from external knowledge base to GitHub repository as single source of truth

---

## Overview

This guide explains the consolidation of FlowEngine documentation from external knowledge base systems into the GitHub repository, establishing the repository as the authoritative source for all current project information.

## üìã **Migration Completed**

### **What Was Consolidated**

**‚úÖ Moved to GitHub Repository:**
- **Feature Matrix Analysis** ‚Üí `docs/specifications/flowengine-feature-matrix.md`
- **Current Capabilities** ‚Üí `docs/current/capabilities.md` 
- **Production Limitations** ‚Üí `docs/current/limitations.md`
- **Performance Characteristics** ‚Üí `docs/current/performance-characteristics.md`
- **Implementation Strategy** ‚Üí `docs/implementation-strategy.md`
- **Development Workflow** ‚Üí `docs/WORKFLOW.md`
- **Production Roadmap** ‚Üí `docs/ROADMAP.md`
- **Architecture Decisions** ‚Üí `docs/DECISIONS.md`
- **JavaScript Optimization Analysis** ‚Üí `docs/recommendations/`

**‚úÖ Archived in GitHub Repository:**
- **Phase 1/2/3 Historical Documents** ‚Üí `docs/archive/phase-1/`, `docs/archive/phase-2/`, `docs/archive/phase-3/`
- **Early Specifications** ‚Üí `docs/archive/early-specs/`
- **Historical Architecture Documents** ‚Üí Organized by development phase

### **What Was Updated**

**‚úÖ Evidence-Based Documentation:**
- Replaced inflated performance claims with measured results
- Documented actual 4K rows/sec vs claimed 200K+ rows/sec
- Added honest production readiness assessment (1.4/10 score)
- Fixed non-existent CLI feature references

**‚úÖ Strategic Planning:**
- Created sprint-lite development methodology
- Defined JavaScript optimization strategy (4-6x improvement potential)
- Established production hardening timeline (18 months)

## üéØ **Single Source of Truth: GitHub Repository**

### **Current State Documentation (Live)**

**Always Reference These for Current Information:**
- `docs/current/capabilities.md` - Working features only, evidence-based
- `docs/current/limitations.md` - Production gaps and honest boundaries  
- `docs/current/performance-characteristics.md` - Measured performance vs claims
- `docs/specifications/flowengine-feature-matrix.md` - 103 features analyzed

**Strategic Planning (Active):**
- `docs/implementation-strategy.md` - Production hardening strategy
- `docs/ROADMAP.md` - 18-month timeline with JavaScript optimization priorities
- `docs/WORKFLOW.md` - Sprint-lite development methodology
- `docs/DECISIONS.md` - Architecture decision log

**Technical Recommendations (Ready for Implementation):**
- `docs/recommendations/javascript-ast-precompilation-optimization.md` - Sprint 1 ready
- `docs/recommendations/javascript-global-context-optimization.md` - Sprint 2 ready
- `docs/recommendations/javascript-context-identification-strategy.md` - Architecture review

### **Historical Context (Reference Only)**

**Use Only for Historical Context:**
- `docs/archive/phase-3/` - Phase 3 development documents
- `docs/archive/phase-2/` - Phase 2 implementation history
- `docs/archive/early-specs/` - Original specifications and early architecture

**‚ö†Ô∏è Important**: All archived documents include "HISTORICAL REFERENCE ONLY" warnings.

## üìö **External Knowledge Base Status**

### **Documents to Mark as "See GitHub Repo"**

**In External Knowledge Base, Update These with Redirect Notice:**

#### **Feature and Capability Documents**
```
‚ùå OUTDATED: See GitHub repository for current state
‚úÖ CURRENT: https://github.com/[repo]/docs/current/capabilities.md

This document is outdated. Current capabilities are documented 
in the GitHub repository with evidence-based analysis.
```

#### **Performance Claims Documents**
```
‚ùå OUTDATED: Performance claims corrected in GitHub
‚úÖ CURRENT: https://github.com/[repo]/docs/current/performance-characteristics.md

Performance claims in this document were inflated. Actual measured 
performance is documented in the GitHub repository.
```

#### **Architecture Planning Documents**
```
‚ùå OUTDATED: See GitHub repository for current architecture decisions
‚úÖ CURRENT: https://github.com/[repo]/docs/DECISIONS.md

Architecture decisions are now tracked in the GitHub repository 
with clear rationale and consequences.
```

#### **Sprint Planning Documents**
```
‚ùå OUTDATED: See GitHub repository for current sprint methodology
‚úÖ CURRENT: https://github.com/[repo]/docs/WORKFLOW.md

Sprint planning now follows the documented sprint-lite methodology 
in the GitHub repository.
```

## üîÑ **Team Transition Guidelines**

### **For Current Information**

**‚úÖ Always Use GitHub Repository For:**
- Feature capability questions ("What can FlowEngine do?")
- Performance characteristics ("How fast is it?")
- Production readiness assessment ("Is it ready for production?")
- Implementation planning ("What should we build next?")
- Architecture decisions ("Why was this approach chosen?")
- Sprint planning ("What's the development methodology?")

### **For Historical Context**

**‚úÖ Use Archive Documentation For:**
- Understanding how the project evolved
- Learning from past decisions and challenges
- Reviewing historical architecture approaches
- Understanding scope changes and priorities

**‚ö†Ô∏è Never Use Archive Documentation For:**
- Current capability assessment
- Production readiness decisions
- Performance expectations
- Implementation planning

### **For External Communication**

**‚úÖ Reference GitHub Repository When:**
- Presenting to architecture teams
- Providing capability assessments
- Planning integrations
- Setting performance expectations
- Making production readiness decisions

---

## üö® **Critical Transition Rules**

### **Information Authority**

**GitHub Repository = Single Source of Truth**
- Any conflicts between external knowledge base and GitHub: **GitHub wins**
- External knowledge base entries should redirect to GitHub
- All new information goes into GitHub first

### **Evidence-Based Standards**

**All Technical Claims Must Be:**
- ‚úÖ Backed by working code or tests
- ‚úÖ Validated with measured results
- ‚úÖ Documented with test scenarios
- ‚ùå Never based on theoretical estimates or aspirational goals

### **Document Lifecycle**

**New Documents:**
1. Create in appropriate GitHub folder (`docs/current/`, `docs/recommendations/`, etc.)
2. Update relevant index documents (README.md, ROADMAP.md)
3. Reference from external knowledge base if needed

**Updates:**
1. Update GitHub repository first
2. Update external knowledge base references if necessary
3. Mark conflicting external documents as outdated

## üìã **Validation Checklist**

### **For Team Members**

**Before Using Any FlowEngine Information:**
- [ ] Check GitHub repository first (`docs/current/` folder)
- [ ] Verify document is not in archive folder
- [ ] Confirm information is evidence-based (includes test results or code references)
- [ ] Check last updated date (should be recent for current capabilities)

**Before Referencing External Knowledge Base:**
- [ ] Confirm information is not available in GitHub repository
- [ ] Verify document doesn't have "See GitHub repo" redirect notice
- [ ] Use only for historical context, not current capabilities

### **For Documentation Updates**

**When Adding New Information:**
- [ ] Add to GitHub repository in appropriate folder
- [ ] Follow evidence-based documentation standards
- [ ] Update related index documents (README.md, ROADMAP.md)
- [ ] Add to todo list for tracking if significant work

**When Finding Outdated Information:**
- [ ] Update GitHub repository with correct information
- [ ] Mark external knowledge base entry as outdated
- [ ] Add redirect notice to GitHub repository
